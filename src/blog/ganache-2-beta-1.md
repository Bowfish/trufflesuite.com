Ganache 2.0.0 is a more well rounded tool in the life cycle of Truffle’s contract management ecosystem. New features are highlighted below and include performance optimizations, new features, general maintenance and bug fixes. It’s exciting to have the option to visually manage your contracts using the UI more efficiently with this new version of Ganache, or on the command line tool with Ganache-Cli. 

The Highlights:

1. New HTTP Server keepAliveTimeout feature specifies the milliseconds the server should wait before moving on. This will be awesome in helping to debug other tools that work with Ganache. 
1. You can now create multiple workspaces to manage multiple Truffle projects in one place. Yes, you now manage and manipulate multiple Truffle projects with Ganache like never before! Projects can be started using our ‘Quickstart’ projects workspace or by adding your own project to a ‘New Workspace’! (Add screen shot) 
1. More control over your projects through the UI, for Accounts, Blocks, Transactions, Logs, and Settings. (Add screenshot) 
1. Notifications when new versions are available! 
1. Performance optimizations, Ganache’s overall speed and performance is much improved, we have added new loading signals for when Ganache is processing data (Add Screenshot) !
